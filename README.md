# US Cooperative Networks and Mapping

This is an expiramental space for producing network graphs and maps of different cooperative sectors in the US. At the CED lab, we are trying to analyze cooperative structures for their impacts on communities, member empowerment, governance, and accessibility. We intend to use this space as a learning center for making R based analyses with visualizations produced through `igraph`, `ggplot2`, `r2d3`, and `r2d3maps`.
